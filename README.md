# Real-time-security-system-from-cats-and-dogs-for-home
People love to have a dog, cat as their pet. At the same time, If there is a toddler in their home some parents are a little nervous about their baby's health. It may risk the babyâ€™s breathing while sleeping, infection from cats/dogs, Stomach illnesses, Ringworm( Very common skin infection), cat scratches, or bites. The objective of this project is to build an alert/notification system from cats and dogs in a specific place (A specific place can be any place where cats and dogs are not allowed to enter. Your toddler/baby/children may be there).


Language using - python
We have to install the library/packages - openCV(cv2), numpy, requests, io, json, pyttsx3, time. (remember pyttsx3 works only in windows if you're in linux install libespeak.)
Don't forget to use YOLO V3 configuration(yolov3.cfg), YOLO V3 Weights file(yolov3.weights), and Coco dataset(coco.names)
You're All Set \('~')/
